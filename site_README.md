# Dummy Website

This folder contains a minimal static website (HTML/CSS/JS) useful as a placeholder or starter.

Files added:

- `index.html`
- `css/style.css`
- `js/main.js`

Quick preview (from the project root):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Edit the files directly to customize the site.
